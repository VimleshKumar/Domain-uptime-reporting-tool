# Domain-uptime-reporting-tool
This tool helps in tracking the domain uptime.
This tool does not use ping for status check, it properly opens http connection for this analysis.
It checks the status of specified domain recursively after every set time of interval.
The report is collected in text file format.
One can send this report to any email.
p.s : i have not given any mailing credential in this code. so fill it in the code to be able to send mail.
